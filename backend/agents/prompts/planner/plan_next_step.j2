Planning next step in ReAct loop.

User Query: "{{ user_query }}"
Overall Strategy: {{ strategy }}

Completed Steps ({{ completed_steps|length }}):
{{ completed_steps }}

Latest Results:
{{ current_results }}

Questions:
1. Have we gathered enough information to answer the user's query?
2. If YES, set continue=false
3. If NO, what's the next step we need to take?

Guidelines:
- Maximum 5 total steps in ReAct mode
- Stop as soon as you have enough data to answer
- Each step should build on previous results
- Don't repeat the same tool/action

Respond in JSON:
{
    "continue": true/false,
    "reasoning": "<why we should/shouldn't continue>",
    "next_step": {  // Only if continue=true
        "tool": "<tool_name>",
        "action": "<specific action to take>",
        "depends_on": "<which previous step's result we're using>"
    }
}
