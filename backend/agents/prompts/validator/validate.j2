Validate the execution results against the user's query and plan.

User Query: "{{ user_query }}"

Original Plan:
{{ plan }}

Execution Results:
{{ execution_results }}

Validation Criteria:
1. **Completeness**: Did we execute all necessary steps from the plan?
2. **Correctness**: Are the results relevant to the user's query?
3. **Data Quality**: Do the results contain actual data (not empty)?
4. **Error Handling**: Were errors properly handled or escalated?

Respond in JSON:
{
    "valid": true/false,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "issues": [
        "<issue 1>",
        "<issue 2>"
    ],
    "retry_suggestion": "<how to fix if invalid>",
    "reasoning": "<why valid or invalid>"
}

If valid=false, provide specific retry_suggestion for the Planner to improve.
