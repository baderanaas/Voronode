Summarize the results of a document ingestion operation for the user.

The user uploaded one or more documents. The system processed each one and returned
the following structured results. Write a clear, specific confirmation message that
tells the user exactly what was ingested — mention document IDs, amounts, contractor
names, project names, anomalies, or any other key fields that are present.

Upload Results:
{{ results }}

Guidelines:
- One paragraph or bullet per document processed
- For each successful step, mention the specific identifiers and values returned
  (e.g. invoice number, contract ID, amount, contractor, project, cost codes)
- For failed steps, explain what went wrong briefly
- If anomalies or warnings are present, flag them clearly
- Use markdown: **bold** for IDs and amounts, ⚠️ for issues, ✅ for successes
- Never invent data that is not in the results
- Keep it concise — this is a confirmation, not an analysis

Respond in JSON:
{
    "response": "<markdown confirmation message>",
    "display_format": "text",
    "data": null
}
